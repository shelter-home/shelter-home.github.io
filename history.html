		<p>Since 1981, SHELTER, a licenced welfare agency, has operated to help abused, abandoned, neglected or at-risk children.</p>
		<p>SHELTER Home for Children began as a result of the idea of a group of seven friends who wished to support the children in a squatter settlement along the Old Klang Road. In order for the children to do well in their studies, they started tuition classes.</p>
		<p>As numbers in the home increased, we moved to our present premises at Jalan Tinggi, Petaling Jaya. Various groups helped by providing tuition and even fostered those in need of foster care placement.</p>
		<p>In time, SHELTER set up ten kindergartens in squatter settlements, the first being in Damansara Dalam (1989). A nominal fee of RM5 per student has been charged. These kindergartens have become an attempt to help children from underprivileged homes get a successful start to life.After 15 years of service, SHELTER agreed to shut down the kindergartens when we saw a dramatic decrease in the number of children attending our kindergartens-the urban affluence often influenced low-income families in their view and their children's educational choices.</p>
		<p>Therefore, in Kajang Prison, we ventured into community youth work among young prisoners. There are about 1,000 delinquents in Kajang Prison and Sg. Buloh . We aim to educate, train and empower young people to recover their self-respect and dignity so that they can enter society at a later date.This is a very gratifying task because the running of social work programmes involves discipline, determination and concentration. This programme has been discontinued.</p>
		<p>We have also launched a youth community centre known as 'DropZone' in addition to venturing into youth prison service. This is a youth hang-out centre where the focus is on young people's personal growth through safe and meaningful activities. The target population is aged 13 - 20 years. It was set up by us initially, but it is now under Leaderonomics.</p>
		<p>For the homes, we saw the need to support teens who were outside parental control. This contributed to the creation of the Home Parenting Scheme Shelter 2 (1987), Shelter 3 (1995), Shelter 4 (1996-2007), which is now known as Shelter 4 (2007) and Shelter 5. (2001-2006).After some years, we felt that it was good that we focused on one particular rising concern, which is the abuse, neglect and the abandonment of children and youth. As such, we narrowed down from 5 homes into just three homes which are Shelter 1, Shelter 2 and Shelter 3. </p>
